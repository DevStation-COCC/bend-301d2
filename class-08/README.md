## Overview

Today we are going to be adding a persistence layer in the form of a SQL database. Relevant data from each API response will be stored in a database, with one table per API.

## Daily Plan

- Warm-up exercise
- Review code challenges
- Introduction of today's code challenge topic
- Code review of lab assignment
- Relational vs. non-relational databases
- Data modeling and schemas
- Primary keys and foreign keys
- Code Demo
- Lab Preview

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing Lecture 8 of Code 301, students will:
- Identify when to persist and cache data in a database and whether the database should be relational or non-relational
- Understand how to create a schema to model their data, including modeling the relationships between several tables
- Write SQL queries to create, read, update, and delete records from a local database using PostgreSQL, a database management system
