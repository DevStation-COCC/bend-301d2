# Lab 10: The Call Stack & Debugging

## Feature Tasks

- Print your `server.js` file—with line numbers—from your fork of your lab 9 repository. Make sure the code text is large enough to read and are only printed on one side of the paper. Tape or staple the paper together to make one large "scroll" of your code.
- Keep laptops closed for this exercise. Ask questions of instructional staff, as needed. 
- You and your partner(s) will be taking notes, building the call stack, and drawing a WRRC diagram as you complete this exercise. Be creative - utilize colored pens or pencils, symbols, and so on, but do not feel like you need to be overly artistic. You may use scratch paper or the whiteboard, but do not use online tools such as a word processor or a drawing application. You will be submitting your printed-out code, notes, and diagram(s) as your lab submission, so be prepared to take a picture of the whiteboard, your notes, etc. so that your TA can grade your work. Make sure your handwriting and drawings are legible.
- If you find a bug in the code, make a note but proceed as if the code were fully functional.
- Plan to spend approximately two hours on one partners' `server.js` code, then switch roles.
- When you are reviewing your own code:
  - You are in charge of drawing a single WRRC diagram of the pieces involved. Your diagram must include the following terms: request, response, client, query, server, database, model, view, controller, port.
  - Indicate the line(s) of code from your `server.js` file that corresponds to each portion of the diagram.
- When you are reviewing your partner's code:
  - You are in charge of tracing the order in which the code is executed. Write notes, numbering the steps, on the printed-out `server.js` file.
  - Animate the call stack using Post-It notes, adding and removing functions as you trace the code execution. As appropriate, include the numbered step on the Post-It note.
- After two hours have passed, switch roles and repeat these steps using your partner's code. Make sure to trace different portions of the code base (e.g.: pick up where you left off).

## Submission Instructions

- Complete your Feature Tasks for the day
