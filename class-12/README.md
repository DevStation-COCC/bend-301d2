# Class 12: Componentization and HTML5 Forms

## Overview

Today we will discuss componentization of our code. Although we will have more files, each one will be smaller and our code will ultimately become more DRY. In particular, there is an opportunity to make our HTML more DRY.

## Daily Plan

- Warm-up exercise
- Review code challenges
- Introduction of today's code challenge topic
- Code review of lab assignment
- Componentization of code into modules
- Code Demo
- Lab Preview

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing lecture 12 of Code 301, students will:
- Understand the benefits of modularizing code into smaller components through the use of EJS partials
