# Code Challenge 14: Review

## Overview

Today's code challenges are a combination of all of the methods and skills you have worked on with previous code challenges. Refer back to the other videos and demos as needed.

## Challenges

1. Check out a new branch in your `data-structures-and-algorithms` repository.
1. Make a new directory in the `code-challenges` directory of your repo named with the challenge for the day.
1. Create a file in this new directory named `challenges-14.test.js`.
1. Copy and paste the **entire content** of today's [code challenge](challenges-14.test.js){:target="_blank"} into the new file.
1. Run `npm test` to execute the tests in the folder for today's challenge.
1. Write code to make the tests pass, one at a time. Let the error messages guide you.
1. Once the test is passing, refactor as needed, then move on to the next challenge.

## Submission

When you have completed the entire set of code challenges and all tests pass, create a pull request from your current branch to the master branch and merge it into master.

Submit a link to your pull request.
