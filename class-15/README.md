# Class 15: Final Project Kick-off

## Overview

Today is the last day of formal lecture. For the remainder of this course, you will be working with your assigned project team to build out your final project. On the last day of class, your group will present your project.

The 301 final exam will become available this weekend and is due Sunday at 11:59 p.m. This exam also serves as the 401 entrance exam. However, it is a graded portion of this course, regardless of your intent to advance to a 401 course.

The exam is open-book, open-Google, open-Stack_Overflow, whatever resources you want to use. The exam is designed to be, in spots, a little bit beyond what has been covered. The intent in those spots is to measure resourcefulness and the ability to adapt and figure something out. Give yourself adequate time for the exam; students typically set aside 2-4 hours where to focus, uninterrupted, on the exam.
